East Neuk Trinity Church does not receive any money from the government or from the national Church of Scotland to keep going. All the money that we as a congregation need to further our work comes from the generous giving of our members and from our investment portfolio.

We take very seriously our command to be good stewards of the resources that are given to us to further the work of the Church. Each year we produce a set of [Congregational Accounts][1].

From time to time we also organise fundraising events to allow people from outwith the membership of the Church to contribute to the work of East Neuk Trinity Church. These events not only help to raise money for the Church but also bring people closer together through fellowship and fun.

We advertise all of our fundraising events locally and also on this website. For more information on our fundraising events please look at the [Activities][2] section of our website.

East Neuk Trinity Church is also supported by people who are not members of the Church but who wish to contribute in some way. To find out more about how you can contribute, please visit the Fundraising section on our home page of our website.
