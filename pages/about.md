Life is a journey and we at East Neuk Trinity Church  would be very pleased to walk part or all of it with you.

A group of ordinary people with a variety of backgrounds, we do not claim to have all the answers, but we are willing to explore life’s questions with you and to join with you as you celebrate life’s rites of passage: births, wedding, funerals and all that happens in between.

We are committed to make God known in this place through our worship, in the way that we respond, connect and reflect the love of God within our communities.

We acknowledge the physical and spiritual aspects of life, and firmly believe both have to be held together to find fulfilment in this life, and to ensure eternal life.

Living in the present and looking to the future, we aim to be creative and compassionate in our interactions with others, non- judgemental and welcoming to all who come through the doors of our churches and into our wider community.

The congregation of East Neuk Trinity Church welcomes you! We invite you to come and visit our places of Worship , East Neuk Trinity Church and Colinsburgh Town Hall.

Please note dates and times of services, details of which are given on this website and in noticeboards. Each Sunday, forthcoming services are noted on the Order of Service.

You will find us a friendly group of people who are anxious that our church and our community should be open and outgoing. Enjoy your visit with us!
